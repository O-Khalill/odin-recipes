  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Deep dish pizza is a thick, hearty style of pizza that originated in Chicago. Unlike traditional pizzas, it has a deep, buttery crust that rises high along the edges of a pan, creating a bowl-like shape. This allows it to be filled with generous layers of cheese, meat or vegetables, and a chunky tomato sauce on top. The result is a rich, filling dish that’s more like a savory pie than a flat pizza. Deep dish pizza is known for its crispy crust, gooey center, and bold flavors.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
    </li>
    <li>
      1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
    </li>
    <li>
      1 ⅛ cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees C)
      </li>
    <li>
      3 cups all-purpose flour
      </li>
    <li>
      ½ cup corn oil
      </li>
    <li>
      1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
      </li>
<li>butter as needed, for greasing</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>steps:</h4>
  <ol>
  <li> Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes. </li>
  <li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours. </li>
  <li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe. </li>
  </ol>
